# Our Lost Game

This game, designed and developed by the Wilmington Christian School Game Programming Class of 2013-14, focuses on fighting enemies and surviving while on a remote island, which isn't as deserted as they first thought. This game is strongly inspired by the TV Show, "Lost", by J.J. Abrams, but their are also many differences between the two, hence making it a loose interpertation.
